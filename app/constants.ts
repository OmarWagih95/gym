    content:` is a term for a low-carb diet (like the Atkins diet). The idea is for you to get more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates. You cut back most on the carbs that are easy to digest, like sugar, soda, pastries, and white bread.

How It Works
How It Works

When you eat less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body eventually runs out of fuel (blood sugar) it can use quickly. This typically takes 3 to 4 days. Then you’ll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. This is called ketosis. It's important to note that the ketogenic diet is a short term diet that's focussed on weight loss rather than the pursuit of health benefits.

People use a ketogenic diet most often to lose weight, but it can help manage certain medical conditions, like epilepsy, too. It also may help people with heart disease, certain brain diseases, and even acne, but there needs to be more research in those areas. Talk with your doctor first to find out if it’s safe for you to try a ketogenic diet, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.

A ketogenic diet may help you lose more weight in the first 3 to 6 months than some other diets. This may be because it takes more calories to change fat into energy than it does to change carbs into energy. It’s also possible that a high-fat, high-protein diet satisfies you more, so you eat less, but that hasn’t been proved yet.


Insulin is a hormone that lets your body use or store sugar as fuel. Ketogenic diets make you burn through this fuel quickly, so you don’t need to store it. This means your body needs -- and makes -- less insulin. Those lower levels may help protect you against some kinds of cancer or even slow the growth of cancer cells. More research is needed on this, though.

Heart Disease

It seems strange that a diet that calls for more fat can raise “good” cholesterol and lower “bad” cholesterol, but ketogenic diets are linked to just that. It may be because the lower levels of insulin that result from these diets can stop your body from making more cholesterol. That means you’re less likely to have high blood pressure, hardened arteries, heart failure, and other heart conditions. It's unclear, however; how long these effects last.


Carbohydrates have been linked to this skin condition, so cutting down on them may help. And the drop in insulin that a ketogenic diet can trigger may also help stop acne breakouts. (Insulin can cause your body to make other hormones that bring on outbreaks.) Still, more research is needed to determine exactly how much effect, if any, the diet actually has on acne. 



Low-carb diets seem to help keep your blood sugar lower and more predictable than other diets. But when your body burns fat for energy, it makes compounds called ketones. If you have diabetes, particularly type 1, too many ketones in your blood can make you sick. So it’s very important to work with your doctor on any changes in your diet.

Ketogenic diets have helped control seizures caused by this condition since the 1920s. But again, it’s important to work with your doctor to figure out what’s right for you or your child. `

    content:`Now that you know 10-minute workouts help your body and mind, what kind of micro workout should you choose? The answer will depend partly on your personal fitness goals. These micro workouts can help improve your fitness, benefit your mood, and help with focus. However, if your overall goal is to run a 5K or lose weight quickly, you may need to intersperse your brief work with other exercise strategies.

If you’re currently not physically active most days or out of shape, 10-minute workouts can help you start an exercise habit that helps you toward your goals. If you haven’t been exercising, talk with your doctor to ensure the activities you select are right for you. Consider starting with 10-minute workouts like walking most days to build up your stamina and get your body used to exercising more. As your fitness improves, you can try interspersing your walks with micro workouts that involve more intensity.

If you exercise occasionally but aren’t as consistent as you like, 10-minute workouts like H.I.I.T. (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts may be a great starting point for you. You can perform these types of workouts at home and may not even need any special equipment. The idea is to perform an activity at a high-intensity level for a short period, followed by a recovery period.

If you’re looking for a way to supplement your exercise routine, 10-minute workouts can be helpful when you travel or on days when you don’t have time for your regular workout. These types of workouts can also help provide variety to your routine.

10-Minute Workouts Can Help You With Your Health and Fitness Goals
Short, 10-minute workouts are better than not exercising at all and can benefit your health, fitness, and mood. These micro workouts can help you establish an exercise routine, which is especially helpful if you’re not currently active. As you find yourself exercising consistently, you may also experience an increase in your self-confidence and motivation to workout.

While short workouts won’t fully prepare you for goals like running a 5K or being a bodybuilder, 10-minute workouts can help vary your routine and help on days when you don’t have much time.`
